# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a digital soroban (Japanese abacus) application for Flutter that provides an authentic abacus experience with multi-touch support and smooth bead animations. The soroban will feature the traditional Japanese configuration with one heavenly bead (go-dama) worth 5 and four earthly beads (ichi-dama) worth 1 per rod. The focus is on creating an interactive learning tool that mimics the physical soroban experience without implementing mathematical operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user learning the soroban, I want to interact with a digital abacus that looks and behaves like a traditional Japanese soroban, so that I can practice bead manipulation and number representation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL display a soroban with an odd number of rods (minimum 7, default 13)
2. WHEN viewing the soroban THEN the system SHALL show each rod with one heavenly bead (go-dama) above the reckoning bar and four earthly beads (ichi-dama) below the reckoning bar
3. WHEN viewing the soroban THEN the system SHALL display unit rod markers (dots) on every third rod to aid in place value identification
4. WHEN the soroban is displayed THEN the system SHALL use traditional biconal bead shapes and authentic color scheme

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to move beads with smooth touch interactions, so that the digital experience feels natural and responsive like a physical soroban.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I touch and drag a bead THEN the system SHALL move the bead smoothly following my finger movement
2. WHEN I release a bead near the reckoning bar THEN the system SHALL automatically snap the bead to the "active" position against the bar
3. WHEN I release a bead away from the reckoning bar THEN the system SHALL automatically snap the bead to the "inactive" position away from the bar
4. WHEN a bead is in motion THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animation with appropriate easing
5. WHEN multiple beads are touched simultaneously THEN the system SHALL support multi-touch interaction for multiple rods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want beads to latch securely in their positions, so that I can accurately represent numbers without beads accidentally moving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bead reaches its active position THEN the system SHALL lock the bead against the reckoning bar with visual and haptic feedback
2. WHEN a bead reaches its inactive position THEN the system SHALL lock the bead in the resting position away from the reckoning bar
3. WHEN a bead is latched THEN the system SHALL require deliberate touch interaction to move it again
4. WHEN beads are latched THEN the system SHALL maintain their positions during device rotation or app backgrounding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work smoothly across different devices and orientations, so that I can use the soroban comfortably on various screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL scale the soroban appropriately while maintaining bead proportions
2. WHEN rotating the device THEN the system SHALL maintain bead positions and adapt the layout for optimal viewing
3. WHEN using on tablets THEN the system SHALL take advantage of larger screen space for better bead visibility and interaction
4. WHEN using on phones THEN the system SHALL ensure beads remain large enough for accurate touch interaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual and audio feedback when interacting with beads, so that the experience feels authentic and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving a bead THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback such as shadow or highlight changes
2. WHEN a bead snaps to position THEN the system SHALL provide haptic feedback if supported by the device
3. WHEN beads collide or interact THEN the system SHALL play appropriate sound effects that mimic physical bead sounds
4. WHEN the app is used in silent mode THEN the system SHALL respect device sound settings and disable audio feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize the soroban appearance and behavior, so that I can personalize my learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing settings THEN the system SHALL allow selection of different numbers of rods (7, 13, 21, 23, 27, or 31)
2. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for different bead materials and colors (wood, marble, plastic themes)
3. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of animation speed and sensitivity
4. WHEN in settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to enable/disable sound effects and haptic feedback
